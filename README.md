## About Us
Campus Lightbox was envisioned and created by Project Aurora.

We are a group of UBC students seeking to dismantle the barriers between
campus mental health resources and those who are in need of it.

We hope to continue the much-Â­needed conversation about student wellness
on college campuses across the country and to empower students to take charge of their mental health.
